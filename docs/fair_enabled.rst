FAIR enabled
============

The OpenAIRE Guidelines epsecially the Literature and DRIVER Guidelines focus elements of the FAIR principles since beginning in 2008. Community based refine and 
enhancement of guidelines over time add elements with their descriptions which are according to motivation of FAIR. 
The following section describe FAIRification process of the institutional & thematic Guidelines.

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The FAIR maturity model: specification and guidelines of the `Research Data Alliance (RDA) <https://www.rd-alliance.org>`_ (DOI: `10.15497/rda00045 <https://doi.org/10.15497/rda00045>`_)
has the aim to specify the objective indicators for the FAIR assessment. The guidelines are intended to assist evaluators to implement the indicators in the evaluation approach or tool 
they manage.

The indicators shown in the above document have different priorities. The section below is an indication of how to classify elements in our OpenAIRE guidelines for determining the 
FAIRness of a repository.

.. _fair_priorities:

Priorities
~~~~~~~~~~

Three levels of importance are defined:

* **Essential**: 

  such an indicator addresses an aspect that is of the utmost importance to achieve FAIRness under most circumstances, or, 
  conversely, FAIRness would be practically impossible toachieve if the indicator were not satisfied.
  
* **Important**: 

  such an indicator addresses an aspect that might not be of the utmost importance  under  specific  circumstances,  but  
  its  satisfaction,  if  at  all  possible,would substantially increase FAIRness.
  
* **Useful**: 

  such an indicator addresses an aspect that is nice-to-have but is not could indicator MAY be satisfied, but not necessarily indispensable.
