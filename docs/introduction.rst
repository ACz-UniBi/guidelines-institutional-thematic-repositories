Introduction
------------

Aim
^^^
The OpenAIRE Guidelines for Literature Repository Managers 4.0 provide
orientation for repository managers to define and implement their local data
management policies according to the requirements of the OpenAIRE - Open Access
Infrastructure for Research in Europe.

Initially, the requirements of the OpenAIRE infrastructure, and the previous
versions of the OpenAIRE Guidelines, were established to support and monitor the
implementation of the `FP7 OA pilot <http://www.openaire.eu>`_. However, this
version of the Guidelines, according to the expansion of the aims of the
OpenAIRE project and infrastructure, has a broader scope. In fact, these
Guidelines are intended to guide repository manager to expose to the OpenAIRE
infrastructure not only EC funded publications, but also other open access and non-open access
publications, regardless of their funding.

So, by implementing these Guidelines, repository managers will not only be
enabling authors who deposit publications in their repository to fulfill the EC
Open Access requirements, and eventually also the requirements of other
(national or international) funders with whom OpenAIRE cooperates,
but also incorporating their publications into the OpenAIRE infrastructure for
discoverability and utilizing value-added services provided by the OpenAIRE portal.

The OpenAIRE Guidelines for Literature Repository Managers 4.0 are 
part of a set of OpenAIRE Guidelines that also includes the OpenAIRE Guidelines
for Data Archive Managers  and the OpenAIRE CERIF-XML profile.
